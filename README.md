# x16-robs-small-games
Adaptations and reimaginings of retro 8-bit games, some of which 
are original concepts.

Some of these are in BASIC, and some are C.  Most are unfinished.

All of them should work on r46.

# Lemonade
This is a port drawn from the C64 and VIC-20 versions to recreate as closely as possible the PET version.
As far as I can tell it works correctly.

# Lunar
This is an adaptation of the original LANDER teletype game in BASIC.
It's only about 80 lines long.

# Petscii-Invaders
A badly conceived start to a Space Invaders clone. There's lots of things wrong with it, 
so I've left it unfinished for now.

# Rogue Forest
A roguelike game taking place in a forest. This is based on an old dimly-remembered game
for the KIM-1 written by (I think) Jim Butterfield (maybe): the goal of this version is to
go into the forest, find the Amulet of Yendor, and escape alive. Random equipment and food
is scattered about the forest (from previous attempts to recover the amulet no doubt).

## Scary Forest
An older, abandoned version of Rogue Forest.

# Spacewar
A re-creation of the old Vectrex game. I'm slowly making progress with it.

# Spelunker
A cavern-exploration game using PETSCII. I haven't gotten far with it yet.

# Sumer
A re-creation of HAMMURABI. It's not complete, and I haven't worked on it for awhile
(BASIC isn't my favorite language).
