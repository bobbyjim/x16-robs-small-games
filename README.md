# x16-robs-small-games
Adaptations and reimaginings of retro 8-bit games, some of which 
are original concepts.

Some of these are in BASIC; some are in C.  Some are unfinished.

# Lemonade (BASIC)
This is a port drawn from the C64 and VIC-20 versions to recreate as closely as possible the PET version.
As far as I can tell it works correctly.

This works on R46.

# Lunar (BASIC)
This is an adaptation of the original LANDER teletype game in BASIC.
It's only about 80 lines long.

This works on R46.

# Petscii-Invaders (C)
A badly conceived start to a Space Invaders clone. There's lots of things wrong with it, 
so I've left it unfinished for now.

It runs in R46... but it's unfinished, and has problems.

# Rogue Forest (BASIC)
A roguelike game taking place in a forest. This is based on an old dimly-remembered game
for the KIM-1 written by (I think) Jim Butterfield (maybe): the goal of this version is to
go into the forest, find the Amulet of Yendor, and escape alive. Random equipment and food
is scattered about the forest (from previous attempts to recover the amulet no doubt).

I had to disable the sound library. That done, it works on R46.

## Scary Forest
An older, abandoned version of Rogue Forest.

# Spacewar (C)
A re-creation of the old Vectrex game. I'm slowly making progress with it.

This works in R46, but it's unfinished.

# Spelunker (C)
A cavern-exploration game using PETSCII. I haven't gotten far with it yet.

This works in R46 but it's very early or prototype-like.

# Sumer (BASIC)
A re-creation of the old HMRABI teletype game. It's not complete, and I haven't worked on it 
for awhile.

This works in R46, but it's not finished.
